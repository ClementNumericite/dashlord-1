By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.</p><p></p><p>CSRF attacks are effective in a number of situations, including:</p><p>    * The victim has an active session on the target site.</p><p>    * The victim is authenticated via HTTP auth on the target site.</p><p>    * The victim is on the same local network as the target site.</p><p></p><p>CSRF has primarily been used to perform an action against a target site using the victim's privileges, but recent techniques have been discovered to disclose information by gaining access to the response. The risk of information disclosure is dramatically increased when the target site is vulnerable to XSS, because XSS can be used as a platform for CSRF, allowing the attack to operate within the bounds of the same-origin policy.</p>"},{"name":"Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion","riskcode":"1","confidence":"2","riskdesc":"Low (Medium)","desc":"<p>The page includes one or more script files from a third-party domain.</p>"},{"name":"Incomplete or No Cache-control Header Set","riskcode":"1","confidence":"2","riskdesc":"Low (Medium)","desc":"<p>The cache-control header has not been set properly or is missing, allowing the browser and proxies to cache content.</p>"},{"name":"Permissions Policy Header Not Set","riskcode":"1","confidence":"2","riskdesc":"Low (Medium)","desc":"<p>Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources.
